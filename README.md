👨‍💻 My first experience with computers - One of my fondest memories was in fifth grade. I would get to computer class to fire up the Macintosh Performa 460, so that I could spend an hour typing little letters on the screen. At the end of a few weeks we would learn that we wrote something beautiful. We were told to run it and if done correctly we would see what we did. The pure joy when that rocket on the screen lifted up was amazing 🚀. I knew that’s what I wanted forever, computers and code. Just for the record though, I did not do it correctlly. My porthole window was off the rocket by about 6mm. 


🌎 My outlook - While looking for inner peace and myself when i was younger, I traveled to some very beautiful countries around the world. I may not have found what I thought I was looking for, but I did learn these three things: 
  1. There is nothing more pure than the kindness of strangers. 
  2. There is nothing more beautiful then the forests of the world 
  3. The grand size of the world is so much larger than you know.
